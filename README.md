# Checking-accuracy-for-a-dataset-using-Bio-inspired-algorithm-with-Random-Forest


In the project we have taken a dataset for that we are checking which algorithm gives the best accuracy.
we have used 2 algorithms, Random forest alone and bio-inspired(JellyFish) with Random forest algorithms.
using bio-inspired algorithm that is JellyFish we are finding the Features using those features in the Random Forest algorithm we are checking for the accuracy.
